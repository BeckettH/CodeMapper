          <p>To the left is a graphic showing the file and folder structure of your project.</p><br>
          <p>If a file can be found at the root level, it will be displayed as a box without a header. If it is inside a folder, it will have a header section
            above the blocks for all the files and nested folders that can be found inside it.</p><br>
          <p>Some files or folders have names that don't fit into this graphic dependending on the size of the screen it's rendering on. These names will be represented by ellipses(...). 
          To find out what their titles are, you can hover over them with a mouse or use a mouse to scroll while your cursor is on the graphic.
          This will zoom into the area around where your cursor is. This can also make titles easier to see.</p><br>
          <p>You can also click and drag the graphic around to look at different areas of it.</p><br>
          <p>To learn more about a Javascript file, click the box with its name. In the right sidebar, these instructions will be replaced with the information about that particular file.</p><br>
          <p>To navigate inside a folder, click the box with its name and the graphic will change to show only the relevant files and nested folders within that folder.</p>
