# CodeMapper

Currently this repo contains:
- filewalker.js: A way to iterate over a file & folder structure to map out all files and folders with their full path, file name, path preceding the file name, and several other options. This can be provided either in a tree or simple list structure. This file is adapted from the recursive-readdir-async npm package.
- babelParse.js: Our start on parsing through a single file to generate an AST, and then having a visitor traverse the AST to do something to the tree based on what it finds
- sampleAST.json: The AST generated by Babel Parse for the filewalker JS file.
- package.json files and this README
