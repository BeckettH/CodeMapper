    Above is a chart showing the dependencies between javascript files in this project.
    For each file on the outside ring, its exports are shown in the same color as the block right below the file name.
    Its imports are shown in another color - matching the color of the file that the imports are coming from.
    Files and node modules only appear here if they are importing or exporting something to a javascript file in the project, so there may be other files that don't appear in this particular chart.
    If you hover over the line between any two files/modules, you'll get a little box with the name of the exporting file/module first, then an arrow pointing right, and then the name of the file/module that's importing something from the first file.
    After that, you'll get a number representing how many things were imported from the first file into the second.
