          <!-- Instructions on how to interact with the visualization -->
          <p>To the left is a chart showing the dependencies between javascript files in this project.</p><br>
          <p>For each file on the outside ring, its exports are shown in the same color as the block right below the file name.</p><br>
          <p>Its imports are shown in another color - matching the color of the file that the imports are coming from.</p><br>
          <p>Files and node modules only appear here if they are importing or exporting something to a javascript file in the project, so there may be files that don't appear in this chart.</p><br>
          <p>If you hover over the line between any two files/modules, you'll get a box with the name of the exporting file/module first, then an arrow pointing right, and then the name of the file/module that's importing something from the first file.</p>
            <!-- After that, you'll get a number representing how many things were imported from the first file into the second. -->
